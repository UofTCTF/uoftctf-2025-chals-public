  Large Language Models are all the rage right now. That's why I designed a program that lets you to create your own! I'm paranoid about security though, so I implemented a small blacklist. Some people reported that it's too restrictive to build useful models, but I don't have time to fix it right now. Its still a work in progress, so I apologize in advance if you experience any technical difficulties. Have fun!
