  After the failure of [My First App](https://github.com/UofTCTF/uoftctf-2024-chals-public/tree/master/Web/My%20First%20App), I decided that I just can't trust user input anymore. So for my second app, I made a website that only allows pre-approved guests to access it. Oh, and I fired the old firewall guy in favor of a new one. The new one is wayyyyy better. Now I'm sure now that it's unhackable!
