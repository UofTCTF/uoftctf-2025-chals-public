Intended solution is to patch the python binary with an added code that dumps the marshalled bytecode when calling the marshal.loads function

This allows for easy dumping of the marshalled code

This only involves adding something like

write(5, "\n\n\n\n\n", 5);
write(5, s, n);

to the file Python/marshal.c in the function marshal_loads_impl

Note:
It is doable to manually reverse and get the keys on each layer manually and decode the bytecodes manually
But the amount of anti tampering added should make this more annoing than just adding 2 lines of code to python source code and compiling it
