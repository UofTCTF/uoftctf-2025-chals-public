  I was feeling indecisive about what to do today, so I decided to train a model to help me. I trained it on a small dataset, and it seems to be working well. Oh, the flag is 9 characters long, and I've hidden each character in its own entry in the dataset. I wonder if you can figure it out?
  The flag for this challenge will not appear in the regular flag format, but will be obvious once you find it. Before submitting, wrap it in `uoftctf{}`
